# ⛅ Weather & Activities App

This is a simple React application for managing activities based on weather conditions. 🌞🌦 The application allows you to add activities and specify if they are suitable for good weather. It fetches weather data from an external API and displays activities accordingly.

## 🛠 Installation and Running the App

To install and run this application, follow the steps below:

1. First, clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone <repository-url>`.

2. Navigate to the project directory with `cd <directory-name>`.

3. Install the necessary dependencies using npm (Node package manager). If you have Node.js installed, this should be as simple as running the command `npm install` in your terminal/command line.

4. After installation is complete, you can start the application by running `npm start` in your terminal/command line. This will start the application and open it in your default web browser. If it doesn't open automatically, you can access it at `http://localhost:3000`.
